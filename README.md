# Overview
---
This project demonstrates basic data manipulation and visualization techniques using Python. It includes both synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing key operations in data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

---

# Technologies Used
**Python Libraries:**
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
- `datetime`: For date-time operations.
- `re`: For regular expressions.

**Environment:**
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive computing environment.

---

# Objectives
- Learn and demonstrate basic data manipulation techniques in Python.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights.
- Practice visualization techniques for data storytelling.

---

# Key Operations
### **Synthetic Data Manipulation**
- Creation of a synthetic Pok√©mon dataset.
- Reordering columns for better readability.
- Adding a new column (`place`) to represent habitats.

### **Real Dataset Cleaning**
- Dropped irrelevant columns from the wine dataset.
- Renamed columns for clarity, e.g., changing default column names to `alcohol`, `malic_acid`, etc.
- Prepared data for further analysis and visualization.

### **Visualizations**
- Set up Matplotlib and Seaborn for inline plotting with visually appealing styles.
- Placeholder for exploring patterns and trends in datasets through plots.

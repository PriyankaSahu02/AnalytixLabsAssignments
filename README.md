# Overview
---
This project demonstrates basic data manipulation and visualization techniques using Python. It includes both synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing key operations in data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

---

# Technologies Used
**Python Libraries:**
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
- `datetime`: For date-time operations.
- `re`: For regular expressions.

**Environment:**
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive computing environment.

---

# Objectives
- Learn and demonstrate basic data manipulation techniques in Python.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights.
- Practice visualization techniques for data storytelling.

---

# Datasets
### **Synthetic Pokémon Dataset**
- Created using a Python dictionary with fields such as name, type, hp, evolution, and pokedex.
- **Focus:** Demonstrate data structuring, column reordering, and feature addition.

### **Wine Quality Dataset**
- A real-world dataset (`wine.txt`) loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Focus:** Cleaning the data by dropping unnecessary columns, renaming fields for clarity, and preparing it for analysis.

---

# Key Operations
### **Synthetic Data Manipulation**
- Creation of a synthetic Pokémon dataset.
- Reordering columns for better readability.
- Adding a new column (`place`) to represent habitats.

### **Real Dataset Cleaning**
- Dropped irrelevant columns from the wine dataset.
- Renamed columns for clarity, e.g., changing default column names to `alcohol`, `malic_acid`, etc.
- Prepared data for further analysis and visualization.

### **Visualizations**
- Set up Matplotlib and Seaborn for inline plotting with visually appealing styles.
- Placeholder for exploring patterns and trends in datasets through plots.

---

# Insights
While the notebook primarily focuses on data manipulation, it sets the groundwork for uncovering insights such as:
- Distribution and relationships in the wine dataset.
- Trends in synthetic Pokémon data (e.g., habitats and attributes).
